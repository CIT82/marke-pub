The CIT 82 public repo for Mark Edmunds

## A Little About Me

A couple of years ago, I was in a position where I was looking to make a career change. I decided to go back to school and get my AS degree in Computer Information System. This last semester I finished my degree and decided to continue on and get an AS in Web Development. I am currently taking CIT 82 along with CIT 99 and later this semester CIT 85, and am looking forward to learning more about web development.

## About This Repo

Along with the required assignments and discussions for CIT 82, I will be adding some content on some development related topics that I find interesting or helpful. It is my hope that this repo will be a resource for me and others as I continue to learn and grow in the field of web development.
