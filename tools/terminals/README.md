# Terminals
This directory contains information on some terminal emulators that I have been using.

##  Use of the Terminal
I know prior to starting my journey learning about software development, I rarely used the terminal. It was something that I only opened to copy and paste a few commands on my Mac to achieve an action that could not be performed in the GUI. But now that has changed I often find myself performing to use the terminal over the GUI for many tasks.

The increased use of the terminal led me to look for alternatives to the default Mac `Terminal.app`. I have found that there are many terminal emulators available that offer more features and customization than the default app.

When you are accustomed to using the mouse and GUI, the terminal can seem a bit intimidating. But once you get the hang of it, you will find that it is a powerful tool that can save you time and make you more productive.

## Terminal Emulators I Have Used
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) is a very new terminal, with the public release in late December 2024. To me this feels like a modern feature rich replacement for the default Mac `Terminal.app`. I have been using it for the past couple of weeks and have been very happy with it. It is available for Mac and Linux. If you are Mac user and still using the default `Terminal.app` I would recommend giving Ghostty a try.

> [!NOTE]
> For some Linux distributions, you may need to build form source.

- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/modern-terminal) is another great terminal that I have been using. It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows. It has a lot of features and customization options. One feature that makes it unique is the command block feature. Each command run appears as a separate block that can be copied, saved, or shared. This is a great feature for sharing commands with others. It also has built-in command completion and built-in AI to help with commands.

> [!NOTE]
> Warp for Windows is currently in a waitlisted beta. The AI feature is free with limited monthly usage. Paid plans are available for more usage.

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) is another terminal that I have used in the past. It is only available for Mac. It has a lot of features and customization options. It is a good terminal. I prefer Ghostty, but if you prefer a GUI interface over a config file for customization, iTerm2 is a great choice.

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is another terminal that I have used, it is available for Mac and Linux. It is a very fast terminal and has a lot of features and customization options. One feature to note is it's ability to display images in the terminal via the kitty's graphics protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> kitty is not the only terminal that can display images. Ghostty, and Wezterm are two other terminals that can display images.
